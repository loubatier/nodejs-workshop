#NodeJS x Twitter API Workshop

##Goal of this workshop
My purpose during this workshop was to improve my non-existent skills in back-end development.
For that we attended a workshop with both NodeJS and Twitter API. We had the possibility to do whatever we wanted with that.

## What the app do 
This micro web app gives the user the opportunity to select two keywords and to make them compete till one of them got 15 tweets.
So you got to select two keywords in both dropdown lists. Then press the "Start vs" button to start the battle.

## Difficulties met during development 
There are severals difficulties I met during this development.
 - Issues with Twitter API : I don't know why but it kept bullying me, `Exceeded connection limit for user` all around and no clue from where it came from and I didn't know how to track it.
 - NodeJS : Complete foreigner to back-end development, even though our teacher made a great job and showed great patience I struggled understanding everything
 - Time : I spent too much time wandering around, reading articles about Twitter API, lab features than doing the actual workshop. Mea culpa
 
## Launching the app
 
#####`npm install` - in order to get all the packages
#####`node index.js` - to start NodeJS server
#####`localhost:8080` - in your browser to select filters and see what the app does

## Overall feeling

Well this workshop was really great, I had a lot of curiosity about all we can do with a real time API like Twitter one. As I said spent more time reading the doc than developing my app but it was worth. I think I'll continue developing this app even after our due date. 

Thanks Mr Beltramo ✌️
